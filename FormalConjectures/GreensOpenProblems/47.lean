Suppose that a large sieve process leaves a set of quadratic size. Is that set quadratic?

The following very particular instance is probably the simplest [Gr24]:
Suppose that $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ is a set with the property that
$|A \pmod p| \leqslant \frac{1}{2}(p + 1)$ for all sufficiently large $p$.
Is it true that either $|A \cap [X]| \ll X^{1/2} / \log^{100} X$, or $A$ is contained in the
image of $\mathbb{Z}$ under a quadratic map $\phi : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$?

is allowed to fail on a finite subset of $A$. -/
