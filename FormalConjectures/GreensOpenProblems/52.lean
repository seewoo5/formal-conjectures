Suppose that $A \subset \mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a set with an additive complement of size $K$.
Does $2A$ contain a coset of codimension $O_K(1)$?

Could $2A$ even contain a coset of codimension $O(\log K)$?

From [Green's 2025 update](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/greenbj/papers/open-problems.pdf#problem.52):

> Update 2025. Kaave Hosseini and Ryan Alweiss have independently pointed out
> that the second question is far too optimistic. To see this, let $A$ be a Hamming ball
> of radius $n/2 - \sqrt{n}$. There is a set $S$ of size $O(n)$ such that
> $A + S = \mathbb{F}_2^n$; a random choice of $S$ will work. However, every subspace
> contained in $A - A$ has codimension $\gg \sqrt{n}$.
