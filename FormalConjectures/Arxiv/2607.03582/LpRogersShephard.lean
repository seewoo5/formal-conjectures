# Planar $L_p$-Rogers-Shephard, the equality case

*Reference:* [arxiv/2607.03582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.03582)
**$L_p$-Rogers-Shephard type inequalities for $L_p$-zonoids and symmetric bodies**
by *Matthieu Fradelizi, Auttawich Manui, Mark Meyer, Cheikh Saliou Ndiaye*

Corollary 29 bounds $|K \oplus_p -K|$ against $|K|$ for planar convex bodies with a centre of
symmetry containing the origin, and notes that parallelograms with a vertex at the origin
attain it. Conjecture 5 asks whether they are the only bodies that do.

/-- The Firey $L_p$-sum $K \oplus_p L$, equation (4) of the source: the body whose support
function is $(h_K^p + h_L^p)^{1/p}$.

The source defines it by that support function, which needs both bodies to contain the origin.
Here it is the intersection of the halfspaces the support function cuts out, which agrees with
the source's set on the bodies the statements below quantify over and needs no separate
existence argument. -/

**Corollary 29 (Fradelizi-Manui-Meyer-Ndiaye, 2026).** For a planar convex body $K$ with a
centre of symmetry containing the origin and $p > 1$,
$$|K \oplus_p -K| \leq \left(\frac{2\Gamma(1+1/q)^2}{\Gamma(1+2/q)} + 2\right)|K|,$$
where $q$ is the Hölder conjugate of $p$.

**Conjecture 5 (Fradelizi-Manui-Meyer-Ndiaye, 2026).** Among planar convex bodies with a

parallelograms with a vertex at the origin.
