# TxGraffiti Conjecture 1: independence, annihilation, and residue

*Reference:* [arxiv/2507.17780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17780)
**In Reverie Together: Ten Years of Mathematical Discovery with a Machine
Collaborator** by *Randy Davila, Boris Brimkov, Ryan Pepper*

Conjecture 1, the oldest of the four TxGraffiti conjectures in the cited
collection (open since 2016), asserts that every nontrivial connected graph $G$
with maximum degree $\Delta \ge 2$ satisfies
$$\alpha(G) \ge \frac{a(G) + R(G)}{\Delta(G)},$$
where $\alpha$ is the independence number, $a$ the annihilation number, $R$ the
Havel–Hakimi residue, and $\Delta$ the maximum degree.

This conjecture is **true**, proved in
[arXiv:2606.29553](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29553) (C. Gupta).

TxGraffiti [Conjecture 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17780):
for every nontrivial connected graph $G$ with $\Delta(G) \ge 2$,
$$\alpha(G) \ge \frac{a(G) + R(G)}{\Delta(G)}.$$

This conjecture is **true**.

**Proof sketch.** Substitute the Caro–Wei lower bound $\alpha \ge W$ for $\alpha$
and reduce to $a \le (\Delta - 1) \alpha$. The case $\Delta = 2$ is trivial
($a = \alpha$). For $\Delta \ge 4$ an AM–HM argument with $m \le (n - a)\Delta$
yields a quadratic whose discriminant is negative. For $\Delta = 3$ the
annihilation number has a closed form in the degree counts $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ and
$a \le 2W$ is verified in three regimes. See
[arXiv:2606.29553](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.29553).
