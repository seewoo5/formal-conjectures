# TxGraffiti Conjecture 4: the saturation number versus the harmonic index

*Reference:* [arxiv/2507.17780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17780)
**In Reverie Together: Ten Years of Mathematical Discovery with a Machine
Collaborator** by *Randy Davila, Boris Brimkov, Ryan Pepper*

TxGraffiti is an automated conjecturing program, a successor of Fajtlowicz's
*Graffiti* and DeLaViña's *Graffiti.pc*. Conjecture 4 in the cited collection
asserts a bound between two graph invariants:

* the *saturation number* $\mu^*(G)$ (`SimpleGraph.saturationNumber`), the
  minimum number of edges in a maximal matching of $G$;
* the *harmonic index* $H(G)$ (`SimpleGraph.harmonicIndex`),
  $\sum_{uv \in E(G)} 2 / (\deg u + \deg v)$.

The conjecture is **false**. It was first refuted by Bıyıkoğlu, who exhibited a
family of counterexamples — a disjoint union of edges joined to an independent
set — with unbounded ratio $\mu^*/H$. That the smallest counterexample has
order $9$, namely the friendship graph $F_4$ formalised below, and that the
windmill family has an exact limiting ratio, are established in Gupta.

TxGraffiti [Conjecture 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17780):
for every nontrivial connected graph $G$, the saturation number is at most
the harmonic index, $\mu^*(G) \le H(G)$.

This conjecture is **FALSE**.

**Counterexample.**
The friendship graph $F_4$ (`friendshipF4`) is connected and nontrivial, with
$\mu^*(F_4) = 4$ and $H(F_4) = 18/5$. Indeed the four rim edges
$\{1,2\}, \{3,4\}, \{5,6\}, \{7,8\}$ form a maximal matching of size $4$, and
no maximal matching is smaller, so $\mu^*(F_4) = 4$; the eight spokes
contribute $2/(8+2) = 1/5$ each and the four rim edges contribute
$2/(2+2) = 1/2$ each, giving $H(F_4) = 8 \cdot 1/5 + 4 \cdot 1/2 = 18/5$.
Since $4 > 18/5$, the bound fails.

More generally the friendship graphs $F_k$ satisfy $\mu^*(F_k) = k$ and
$H(F_k) = 2k/(k+1) + k/2$, so the conjecture fails for every $k \ge 4$. An
exhaustive search confirms that $F_4$ is the smallest counterexample
(order $9$). The unbounded separation was first shown by Bıyıkoğlu, whose
family of edges joined to an independent set makes $\mu^*/H$ arbitrarily
large; the windmill generalisation and its exact limit appear in
[arXiv:2606.15761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.15761).
