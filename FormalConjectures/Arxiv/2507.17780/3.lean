# TxGraffiti Conjecture 3: independent domination versus saturation (regular)

Conjecture 3 (open since 2020) asserts that for every $r$-regular graph $G$
(every vertex has degree $r$),
$$i(G) \le \mu^*(G),$$
where $i(G)$ is the independent domination number and $\mu^*(G)$ the saturation
number (minimum size of a maximal matching).
