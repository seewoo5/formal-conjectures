# Cunningham chains — Jones's conjecture

A Cunningham chain is a sequence of primes satisfying either $p_{i+1}=2p_i+1$
(first kind) or $p_{i+1}=2p_i-1$ (second kind). It is conjectured that there
are infinitely many chains of every positive exact length, of both kinds.

A chain has **exact length k** when its first $k$ terms are prime and the
$(k+1)$-th generated term is composite.

Lenny Jones conjectures that for every positive integer $k$, infinitely many
primes start a chain of exact length $k$, for each of the two kinds.
