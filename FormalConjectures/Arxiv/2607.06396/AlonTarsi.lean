  **Some new results on Sylvester colorings of cubic graphs**
  by *Luca Ferrarini, Vahan Mkrtchyan*, where this is Conjecture 4.

Every bridgeless graph has a list of cycles covering every edge whose lengths sum to at most
$\frac{7}{5}|E|$.

**Conjecture 4 (Alon-Tarsi, 1985).** Every bridgeless graph has a list of cycles covering
every edge, with $\sum_{C} |E(C)| \leq \frac{7}{5}|E(G)|$.
