# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 85

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Counterexample

The conjecture is false for the lexicographic product $C_5[K_4]$. This graph
has minimum even-distance count $9$ and largest induced-tree order $4$. The
conjectured lower bound is therefore $\lceil\sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot 9}\rceil =
\lceil\sqrt{19}\rceil = 5 > 4$.

WOWII [Conjecture 85](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)
asked whether every simple connected graph $G$ satisfies
$\operatorname{tree}(G) \geq
\lceil\sqrt{1 + 2\min_v \operatorname{distEven}(v)}\rceil$.
The answer is no, as witnessed by $C_5[K_4]$.
