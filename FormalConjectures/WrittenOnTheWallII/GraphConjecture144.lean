WOWII [Conjecture 144](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph $G$,
$\mathrm{tree}(G) \ge \mathrm{girth}(G) - 1 + \mathrm{ecc}(\mathrm{Centers})$
where $\mathrm{tree}(G)$ is the largest induced tree size, $\mathrm{girth}(G)$ is
the length of the shortest cycle ($0$ if acyclic),
$\mathrm{Centers} = G.\mathrm{center}$ is the set of vertices with minimum
eccentricity (the center of $G$), and $\mathrm{ecc}(\mathrm{Centers})$ is the
eccentricity of the center set — the maximum distance from any non-center
vertex to the nearest center vertex.

**Proof sketch.** Let $g = \mathrm{girth}(G)$ and
$e = \mathrm{ecc}(G, \mathrm{center}(G))$. The acyclic and $e = 0$ cases are
immediate. If $g \le e + 2$, the formalized Bacsó--Tuza induced-path argument,
with an elementary $e = 1$ case, produces an induced tree on at least $2e + 1$
vertices. Since $g - 1 + e \le 2e + 1$, this proves the result.

Suppose instead that $e + 3 \le g$, and fix a shortest cycle $C$. Removing one
vertex of $C$ leaves an induced tree on $g - 1$ vertices. Analyze the connected
components outside $C$. If one has at least $e$ vertices, it supplies an
attached rooted induced tree of order $e$. Otherwise, let $D$ be the sum of the
components' attachment depths. If $D \ge e$, select pairwise edge-separated
rooted branches of total order $e$ and attach them to $C$, deleting a suitable
cycle vertex. If $D < e$, shortest-cycle contact restrictions bound
corresponding exclusion arcs. Their complement consists of central cycle
vertices and $D$-dominates the graph, forcing $e \le D$, a contradiction.

Finite graph search was used only during discovery to test candidate
structural lemmas and reject false proof templates; no finite-search result is
used in the universal proof.
