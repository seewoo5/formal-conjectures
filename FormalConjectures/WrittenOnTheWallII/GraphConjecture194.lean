# Written on the Wall II - Conjecture 194

*Reference:*
[E. DeLaVina, Written on the Wall II, Conjectures of Graffiti.pc](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

## Counterexample

The conjecture is false. Take a clique on vertices `0, ..., 10`, four additional vertices
`11, ..., 14` adjacent to every clique vertex, and three leaves attached at `11`, `12`, and `14`.
This connected graph has independence number `4`, while the sum of the independence numbers of its
vertex neighbourhoods is `54`, so their average is `3`. Thus it satisfies the conjecture's
hypothesis with equality. However, its three leaves would all have to be endpoints of a Hamiltonian
path, which is impossible.

WOWII [Conjecture 194](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph `G`, if `α(G) ≤ 1 + l_avg(G)`, then `G` has a Hamiltonian path.
Here `α(G) = G.indepNum` is the independence number, and
`l_avg(G) = averageIndepNeighbors G` is the average over all vertices of the independence number
of the neighbourhood.
A Hamiltonian path is a walk visiting every vertex exactly once. The answer is no, as witnessed by
the 18-vertex graph described above.
