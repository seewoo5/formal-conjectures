# Testing Graph Invariants

This file contains tests for graph invariants on 5 specific concrete graphs:
1. `HouseGraph`: A graph on 5 vertices.
2. `K4`: The complete graph on 4 vertices.
3. `PetersenGraph`: The Petersen graph on 10 vertices.
4. `C6`: The cycle graph on 6 vertices.
5. `Star5`: The star graph with 5 leaves (6 vertices total).

Tests cover:
independence_number, dominationNumber, average_distance, diameter, radius,
girth, order, size, szeged_index, wiener_index, min_degree, max_degree,
average_degree, matching_number, residue, annihilation_number, cvetkovic.
