WOWII [Conjecture 142](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/):

For a simple connected graph $G$,
$\mathrm{tree}(G) \ge (2/3) \cdot \mathrm{girth}(G) + \mathrm{ecc}(B)$
where $\mathrm{tree}(G)$ is the largest induced tree size, $\mathrm{girth}(G)$
is the length of the shortest cycle ($0$ if acyclic), $B$ is the set of
boundary vertices (those of maximum eccentricity), and $\mathrm{ecc}(B)$ is
the eccentricity of the set $B$.

**Proof sketch.** The proof first strengthens the real-valued target to the
integral bound
$$
\mathrm{ecc}(B) + \mathrm{girth}(G)
  - \lfloor \mathrm{girth}(G) / 3 \rfloor \leq \mathrm{tree}(G).
$$
For a cyclic graph, start with a shortest cycle $K$. It is chordless, so
removing one vertex leaves an induced path on $\mathrm{girth}(G)-1$ vertices.
Shortest paths from selected vertices to $K$ are called *descents*. Pairwise
noninteracting descents attach to the retained cycle path as disjoint branches.
If two descents interact, the proof cuts at the first interaction encountered
from the outer endpoint toward the cycle and splices the paths there.
Minimality of that interaction makes the retained prefix disjoint and
nonadjacent to the first descent; geodesicity excludes chords, while girth at
least five rules out extra cross-edges and cycle attachments.

Choose a vertex realizing $\mathrm{ecc}(B)$ and two endpoints of a diametral
geodesic. Either two of their descents interact, directly giving a sufficiently
long spliced tree, or all three are separate, in which case a three-point
distance inequality forces their total length to be large enough. This proves
the integral bound in the main range. Girths three and four, small
$\mathrm{ecc}(B)$, and the two remaining congruence cases are handled by
separate geodesic/cycle certificates with one or two descents; the acyclic case
follows from a diametral path. Finally,
$$
\mathrm{girth}(G)-\lfloor\mathrm{girth}(G)/3\rfloor
  = \lceil 2\,\mathrm{girth}(G)/3\rceil
  \geq 2\,\mathrm{girth}(G)/3,
$$
which gives the stated real-valued inequality.
