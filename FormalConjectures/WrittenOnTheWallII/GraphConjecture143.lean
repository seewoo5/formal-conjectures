WOWII [Conjecture 143](http://cms.uhd.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/all.html#conj143):

For a simple connected graph $G$,
$\mathrm{tree}(G) \ge (\mathrm{girth}(G) + 1) / \sigma(G)$,
where $\mathrm{tree}(G)$ is the largest induced tree size, $\mathrm{girth}(G)$
is the length of the shortest cycle, and
$\sigma(G) = G.\mathrm{secondSmallestDegree}$ is the **second-smallest degree**
of $G$'s degree sequence (per WOWII defEntry 65). We state the inequality in
denominator-free form to avoid the $\sigma = 0$ corner case ($n \le 1$).

The proof splits into the acyclic case and two cyclic cases. For an acyclic
graph the girth is zero. If $\sigma \ge 2$, deleting two consecutive edges from
a shortest cycle leaves an induced tree on $\mathrm{girth}(G)-1$ vertices, and
the factor $\sigma \ge 2$ yields the required inequality. If $\sigma = 1$,
there are two degree-one vertices. A maximal induced tree containing them must
have an external vertex with two attachments; those attachments create a cycle
whose length forces the tree to contain at least $\mathrm{girth}(G)+1$ vertices.
