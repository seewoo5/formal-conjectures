WOWII [Conjecture 2](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

For a simple connected graph $G$,
$Ls(G) \ge 2 \cdot (l(G) - 1)$ where $l(G)$ is the average independence number of
the neighbourhoods of the vertices of $G$.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763), where an informal proof is also provided.

Another formal proof combines a spanning-tree leaf bound from connected domination
with an ordered-pair double-counting argument for adjacent neighbourhoods.

A third formal proof starts from a triangle-free spanning subgraph of $G$ with the maximum
number of edges. Maximality bounds the neighbourhood independence number of each vertex by its
degree in that subgraph; an edge whose endpoint degrees sum to at least $2 \cdot l(G)$ then
carries a double star, which is acyclic and extends to a spanning tree with at least
$2 \cdot (l(G) - 1)$ leaves.
