# Riemann Hypothesis and Generalized Riemann Hypothesis

The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function
$\zeta(s)$ have real part $\frac{1}{2}$. The trivial zeros are the negative even integers
$-2, -4, -6, \ldots$. The hypothesis is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems
posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

The Generalized Riemann Hypothesis extends this to Dirichlet $L$-functions of primitive
Dirichlet characters.

/-- The **Riemann Hypothesis**: all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real
part $\frac{1}{2}$. That is, if $\zeta(s) = 0$, $s \neq 1$, and $s$ is not a trivial zero
$-2(n+1)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\operatorname{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$.

This is the official Millennium Prize Problem as posed by the
[Clay Mathematics Institute](https://www.claymath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/riemann.pdf).

This uses the `RiemannHypothesis` type from Mathlib, which is defined as
`∀ (s : ℂ), riemannZeta s = 0 → (¬∃ n : ℕ, s = -2 * (n + 1)) → s ≠ 1 → s.re = 1 / 2`. -/

/-- Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character, `trivialZeros` is the set of trivial zeros of the
Dirichlet $L$-function of $\chi$ which is always a set of non-positive integers.
- $\chi = 1$ then the Dirichlet $L$-function is the Riemann zeta function, having trivial
  zeroes at all negative even integers (exclude $0$).
- $\chi$ is odd, then the trivial zeroes are the negative odd integers.
- $\chi \neq 1$ is even, then the trivial zeroes are the non-positive even integers. -/
