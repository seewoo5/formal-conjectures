A028859 (OEIS): $a(n+2) = 2 \cdot a(n+1) + 2 \cdot a(n)$; $a(0) = 1$, $a(1) = 3$.

Conjecture: The sequence a(n) is also the number of compositions of $n$ into positive integers
such that adjacent parts and the largest part differ by at most 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, May 19 2020

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
