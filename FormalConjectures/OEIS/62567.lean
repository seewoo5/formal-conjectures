/--
The conjecture that $a(3^n) = 10^{3^{n-2}} - 1$ for $n > 1$ was shown to be false for $4 < n < 21$
by Farideh Firoozbakht, who conjectured that for all $n > 4$, $a(3^n) \neq 10^{3^{n-2}} - 1$.
This latter conjecture is proved here.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
