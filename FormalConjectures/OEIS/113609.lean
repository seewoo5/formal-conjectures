A number $n$ is an "OEIS prime power" (for the context of A113609's definition)
if $n=1$ or $n$ is a standard prime power.

The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is the number of prime powers $q<=n$ such that also $q+2$ is a prime power.
$$a(n) = \operatorname{card} \{q \in \mathbb{N} \mid 1 \le q \le n \land P(q) \land P(q+2) \}$$

(25,27) is the smallest pair of prime powers (q,q+2) such that both q and q+2 are not primes,
conjecture: there are more (but not < 10^6).
