The state of the Rule 167 elementary cellular automaton at time $t$ and position $x$.
The initial condition is a single ON cell at $x=0$.
$C(t, x)$ is structurally recursive on $t$.

/--
Decimal representation of the middle column of the "Rule 167" elementary cellular automaton
starting with a single ON (black) cell.
The term $a(n)$ is the decimal value of the binary number $C_{0, 0} C_{1, 0} \dots C_{n, 0}$,
where $C_{i, 0}$ is the state of the center cell at time $i$.
$$a(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n C_{k, 0} \cdot 2^{n-k}$$

  Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) fun k => (middleColumnBit k) * (2^ (n - k))

/-- The floor term in the conjectured recurrence relation for A267581.
This term, $\lfloor (1/2)^{(2^{n+1} \bmod n)} \rfloor$, simplifies to 1 if $(2^{n+1} \bmod n) = 0$
(i.e., $n \mid 2^{n+1}$), and 0 otherwise.
Since the recurrence is only stated for $n \ge 2$, the $n=0$ case is irrelevant
to the conjecture. -/

Conjecture: $a(n) = 2 a(n-1) + 1 - \lfloor (1/2)^{2^{n+1} \bmod n} \rfloor$ for $n \ge 2$. - _Andres Cicuttin_, Mar 29 2016

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
