/-- Nonacci number (Fibonacci 9-step number).
$F_9(n)$ is defined by the linear recurrence $F_9(n+9) = \sum_{i=0}^8 F_9(n+i)$,
with $F_9(0) = \dots = F_9(7) = 0$ and $F_9(8) = 1$. -/

The primary defining sequence `a`.
`a n` is the sum of squares of nonacci numbers (Fibonacci 9-step numbers).
The official sequence matches the sum up to `n + 1` of the standard nonacci numbers
to align with the offset.

Primes in this sequence include: $a(8) = 2$.
Semiprimes in this sequence include: $a(9) = 6 = 2 * 3$, $a(10) = 22 = 2 * 11$,
$a(11) = 86 = 2 * 43$, $a(13) = 1366 = 2 * 683$, $a(14) = 5462 = 2 * 2731$,
$a(16) = 87382 = 2 * 43691$, $a(17) = 348503 = 37 * 9419$,
$a(27) = 358201316657 = 71 * 5045088967$.
(Note: The OEIS comment uses 1-based indexing, so their indices are shifted by +1 compared
to this formalization).
