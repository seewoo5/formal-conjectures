# Maximal run lengths in the second MSB of Tribonacci numbers $T(n)$

The Tribonacci numbers $T_n$ (A000073).
$T_0=0, T_1=0, T_2=1$, and $T_n = T_{n-1} + T_{n-2} + T_{n-3}$ for $n \ge 3$.

Second most significant bit of the tribonacci number A000073(n).
This is formalized by extracting the bit at position $\lfloor \log_2 T_n \rfloor - 1$.

/--
It is conjectured that after the first two 0's, the number of consecutive 0's is only 4 or 5, and the number of consecutive 1's is only 3 or 4 (tested up to $n = 10^4$).

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
