# Number of symbols '*' and '^' to write the canonical prime factorization of n

The canonical prime factorization is $n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$.
The written form is $p_1^{\wedge} e_1 * p_2^{\wedge} e_2 * \cdots * p_k^{\wedge} e_k$,
where the $\wedge$ appears only if $e_i > 1$.
$a(n) = (\text{number of distinct prime factors}) - 1 +$
$(\text{number of distinct prime factors with exponent } > 1)$.

It is conjectured that $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,11$ are the only positive integers
which cannot be represented as the sum of two elements of indices $n$ such that $a(n) = 1$.
