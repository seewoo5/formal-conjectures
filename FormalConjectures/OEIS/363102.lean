# Primality of continued fraction denominators $a(n)$ for $n \ge 3$

Auxiliary sequence A051403, defined as
$$\frac{(n+2) \sum_{k=0}^n k!}{2}$$

Denominator of the continued fraction $1/(2-3/(3-4/(4-5/(...(n-1)-n/(-2)))))$.
The sequence is defined by the formula:
$$a(n) = \frac{n^2 - 2}{\gcd(n^2 - 2, 2 \cdot A051403(n-3) + n \cdot A051403(n-4))}$$
The formula is valid for $n \ge 3$.

Conjecture: The sequence contains only 1's and primes.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
