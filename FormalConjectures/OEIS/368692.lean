# Integrality of the factorial ratio $\frac{(12n+6)! (6n+9)!}{108 (4n+2)! (2n+3)! ((6n+5)!)^2}$

The factorial ratio
$$a(n) = \frac{(12n + 6)! \cdot (6n + 9)!}{108 \cdot (4n + 2)! \cdot
(2n + 3)! \cdot ((6n + 5)!)^2}$$
It is conjectured that $a(n)$ are integers.

It is conjectured here that $a(n)$ are integers.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
