# Home primes (OEIS A037274)

Starting from an integer $n\geq 2$, list its prime factors in nondecreasing order with
multiplicity, concatenate their decimal representations, and repeat. The home-prime conjecture
says that this process always reaches a prime.

For example,

$$25 \longmapsto 55 \longmapsto 511 \longmapsto 773.$$
