Prime for $a(1) = 3$, $a(2) = 11$, $a(4) = 15131$; semiprime for $a(3) = 123 = 3 * 41$,
$a(5) = 228947163 = 3 * 76315721$.
$a(6)$, added by Jonathan Vos Post, has 4 prime factors.
$a(7) = 41 * 811^2 * 106693969 * 317171188688357726699 * 8272236925540996054440172449761$.
When is the next prime in the sequence?
