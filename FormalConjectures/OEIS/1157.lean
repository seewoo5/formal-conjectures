Conjecture: For each k = 2,3,..., all the rational numbers
$\frac{\sigma_k(n)}{n^k} = \sum_{d|n} \frac{1}{d^k}$ (n = 1,2,3,...) have pairwise distinct
fractional parts. - Zhi-Wei Sun, Oct 15 2015

theorem conjecture :
  ∀ k : ℕ, 2 ≤ k →
    ∀ n₁ n₂ : ℕ, 0 < n₁ → 0 < n₂ → n₁ ≠ n₂ →
      Int.fract (↑((sigma k) n₁) / (↑n₁ ^ k : ℚ)) ≠
        Int.fract (↑((sigma k) n₂) / (↑n₂ ^ k : ℚ)) := by
