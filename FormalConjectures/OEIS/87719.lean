# Conjectures associated with A087719

Define $\varsigma(n)$ the smallest prime factor of $n$ (`Nat.minFac`). Let $a_n$ be the least
number such that the count of numbers $k \le a_n$ with $k > \varsigma(k)^n$ exceeds the count
of numbers with $k \le \varsigma(k)^n$.

The conjecture states that $a_n = 3^n + 3 \cdot 2^n + 6$ for $n \ge 1$.
