/--
The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is defined by the recurrence relation $a(n) = 3 a(n-1) + a(n-2) - 3 a(n-3)$
with initial terms $a(0)=1, a(1)=3, a(2)=5$.

def a : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 1
  | 1 => 3
  | 2 => 5
  | n + 3 => 3 * a (n + 2) + a (n + 1) - 3 * a n

/--
The current sequence contains primes, including $3, 5, 41, 21523361$.
Is there an $(a, b, c)$ weighted tribonacci sequence with $a, b, c$ relatively prime
which is prime-free?
