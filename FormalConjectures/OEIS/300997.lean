# Step difference bound $a(n+1) - a(n) \in \{1, 2\}$ in mass-redistribution cellular automata

$a(n)$ is the number of steps needed to reach a stable configuration in the 1D cellular
automaton initialized with one cell with mass $n$ and based on the rule "each cell gives half of
its mass, rounded down, to its right neighbor".
The stable configuration is $n$ cells with mass 1.

Conjecture: It appears that the finite difference of this sequence only contains 1's and 2's.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
