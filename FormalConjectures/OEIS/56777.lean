# Conjectures associated with A056777

A056777 lists composite numbers $n$ satisfying both $\varphi(n+12) = \varphi(n) + 12$ and
$\sigma(n+12) = \sigma(n) + 12$.

The conjectures state identities connecting A056777 and prime quadruples (A007530), as
well as congruences satisfied by the members of A056777.
