The sequence $a(n)$ is defined by $a(n) = \binom{2n}{n}^3$.
We use `Nat.choose (2 * n) n` for the central binomial coefficient.

/--
The finsupp corresponding to the monomial $x^n y^n z^n$.
This is the map $\lambda i. n$. Since `Fin 3` is finite, this function is finitely supported.

The polynomial $pPoly(X, Y, Z) = (1 + X + Y + Z)^{2n} (1 + X + Y - Z)^n (1 + X - Y + Z)^n$.
We identify $X_0, X_1, X_2$ with $X, Y, Z$.

Conjecture: $a(n) = [x^n y^n z^n] (1+x+y+z)^{2n} (1+x+y-z)^n (1+x-y+z)^n$. - _Peter Bala_, Apr 10 2022

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
