Let $\zeta$ be a primitive $(2n+1)$-th root of unity. Then the permanent of the
$2n \times 2n$ matrix $[m(j,k)]_{j,k=1..2n}$ is $a(n)/(2n+1) = ((2n)!!)^2/(2n+1)$,
where $m(j,k)$ is $1$ or $(1+\zeta^{j-k})/(1-\zeta^{j-k})$ according as $j = k$ or not.
- Zhi-Wei Sun, Jun 26 2022

Proved by [SSX22], Theorem 1.3(ii): for odd $m > 1$ and $\zeta$ a primitive $m$-th root of
unity, the permanent of $[c_{j,k}]_{1 \le j,k \le m-1}$ is $((m-1)!!)^2/m$. Take $m = 2n+1$;
translating both matrix indices by one leaves $j - k$ unchanged. For $n = 0$ the matrix is
empty and both sides are $1$.-/
