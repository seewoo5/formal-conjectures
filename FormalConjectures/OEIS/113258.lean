The primary defining sequence `a`.
$a(n)$ is the ascending descending base exponent transform of factorials.
$$a(n) = \sum_{i = 1}^n (i!) ^ {(n-i+1)!}$$

def a (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  ∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, (i + 1)! ^ (n - i)!

theorem a_1 : a 1 = 1 := by rfl

Is there a nontrivial power after $a(4) = 5^3$?
