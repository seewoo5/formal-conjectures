# $a(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n \binom{2n-i}{n+i}$

Alternatively the sequence `a` can be defined as
$a(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n+k-1}{k} F(n-k+1)$, where $F(m)$ is the $m$-th Fibonacci number.
We formalize a conjecture about the number of words of length $n$ in a set $X$ being related
to this sequence.

"The number of words of length $n$ for $n \le 12$ is given by $a(n+1)$. Is this always true?"

Formalized as $|X_n| = a(n-1)$ for $n \ge 1$, because the sequence values $a(0)=1, a(1)=2, a(2)=7$
match the examples given for word lengths $n=1, 2, 3$ respectively.
