# Square odd-indexed terms in the recurrence $a(n) = 8a(n-1) - 8a(n-2) + 8a(n-3) - a(n-4)$

A113254: Corresponds to $m = 8$ in a family of 4th-order linear recurrence sequences.

The sequence $a(n)$ is defined by the initial conditions $a(0)=-1, a(1)=4, a(2)=176, a(3)=3136$,
and the linear recurrence relation
$a(n) = -4 * a (n-1) + 256 * a (n-3) + 4096 * a (n-4)$ for $n \ge 4$.

Conjecture: $a(8, 2n+1)$ is a perfect square for all $n$ (see A113249).

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
