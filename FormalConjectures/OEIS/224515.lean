# Existence of integers $k$ with $k^2 \operatorname{XOR} (k+1)^2 = (2n+1)^2$

a: $a(n) = \text{least } k \text{ such that } \sqrt{k^2 \operatorname{XOR} (k+1)^2} = 2n+1$,
$a(n) = -1 \text{ if there is no such } k$.
This is equivalent to finding the smallest $k \in \mathbb{N}$
such that $k^2 \oplus (k+1)^2 = (2n+1)^2$.
We use the set infimum ($\operatorname{sInf}$) to denote the least element
of the set of natural numbers satisfying the condition.
Since Mathlib's `sInf` on a subset of `ℕ` gives a result in `ℕ`, this definition
is only completely faithful to the OEIS when the set is non-empty.
The OEIS definition implies that the set of k's is non-empty for all n.

a: $a(n) = \text{least } k \text{ such that } \sqrt{k^2 \operatorname{XOR} (k+1)^2} = 2n+1$,
$a(n) = -1 \text{ if there is no such } k$.
This is equivalent to finding the smallest $k \in \mathbb{N}$
such that $k^2 \oplus (k+1)^2 = (2n+1)^2$.
We use the set infimum ($\operatorname{sInf}$) to denote the least element
of the set of natural numbers satisfying the condition.
Since Mathlib's `sInf` on a subset of `ℕ` gives a result in `ℕ`, this definition
is only completely faithful to the OEIS when the set is non-empty.
The OEIS definition implies that the set of k's is non-empty for all n,
which is legitimate as shown by the theorem `exists_xor_sq_eq` below.

Conjecture: $a(n) \ge 0$, i.e., for every $n$ there exists $k$ such that $\sqrt{k^2 \oplus (k+1)^2} = 2n+1$.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
