# Fibonacci transform satisfying $|a(n)| = F(n+1)$

The sequence $a(n)$ satisfies the linear recurrence relation:
$$a(n) = 3a(n-1) - 4a(n-2) + 2a(n-3) - a(n-4)$$
with initial terms $a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=1, a(3)=0$.
The sequence takes values in $\mathbb{Z}$.

Fibonacci transform satisfying $|a(n)| = F(n+1)$.

Conjecture: all elements in absolute value are Fibonacci numbers.

A formal proof has been found with the methods described in
[arxiv/2605.22763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22763).
