The primary defining sequence `a`.
`a n` is the number of decompositions of `2n+1` into `2p+q`, where `p` and `q` are both odd primes.
-/
def a (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  -- We count the number of odd primes $p$ that satisfy the constraints.
  -- The range $p \le n$ is sufficient, as larger $p$ would make $q \le 1$, which is not prime.
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun p : ℕ =>
    -- p must be an odd prime.
    p.Prime ∧
    p ≠ 2 ∧
    -- Ensure the expression for $q$ is positive, so Nat subtraction is well-defined for prime $q$.
    2 * p < 2 * n + 1 ∧
    -- q = 2n+1 - 2p must be prime (and is automatically odd).
    Nat.Prime (2 * n + 1 - 2 * p)
  ) (Finset.range (n + 1)))

Conjecture: all items for $n \ge 4$ are greater than or equal to $1$. This is a stronger
conjecture than the Goldbach conjecture.
