Does there exist an absolute constant $c>0$ such that, for all $r\geq 2$, in any $r$-uniform
hypergraph with chromatic number $3$ there is a vertex contained in at least $(1+c)^r$ many edges?

This was solved by Erdős and Lovász [ErLo75], who proved in particular that there is a vertex
contained in at least $\frac{2^{r-1}}{4r}$ many edges.
