If $A_1, A_2$ are disjoint additive bases of order $2$ (i.e. $A_i + A_i$ contains all large
integers) then must $A = A_1 \cup A_2$ contain a minimal additive basis of order $2$ (one such that
deleting any element creates infinitely many $n \notin A + A$)?

A question of Erdős and Nathanson [ErNa88, Er92c]. The answer is no: Larsen [La26] constructed
disjoint bases $A_1, A_2$ of order $2$ such that $A_1 \cup A_2$ contains no minimal basis of
order $2$.
