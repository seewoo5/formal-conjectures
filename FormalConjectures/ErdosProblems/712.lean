Determine, for any $k>r>2$, the limiting value as $n\to\infty$ of
$$\frac{\mathrm{ex}_r(n,K_k^r)}{\binom{n}{r}},$$
where $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,K_k^r)$ is the largest number of $r$-edges which can placed on $n$ vertices
so that there exists no set of $k$ vertices which is covered by all $\binom{k}{r}$ possible
$r$-edges.
