A set `A` of natural numbers has the property in the question if `a + b ≠ 2 ^ k` for all
`a, b ∈ A` (not necessarily distinct) and all `k ≥ 0`.

Does there exist $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with lower density $>1/3$ such that $a+b\neq 2^k$ for
any $a,b\in A$ and $k\geq 0$?

Müller [Mu11] settled this question in the affirmative: in fact one can take $A$ to be
the set of all integers congruent to $3\cdot 2^i\pmod{2^{i+2}}$ for any $i\geq 0$, which has
density $1/2$.

theorem erdos_1136 : answer(True) ↔
    ∃ A : Set ℕ, (1 / 3 : ℝ) < A.lowerDensity ∧ AvoidsPowersOfTwo A := by
  sorry

/--
Achieving density $1/3$ is trivial, taking $A$ to be all multiples of $3$.

Müller also proved this is best possible, in that $A$ with the property in the question has
lower density at most $1/2$.
