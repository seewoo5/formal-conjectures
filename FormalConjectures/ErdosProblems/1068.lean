Two walks are internally disjoint if they share no vertices other than their endpoints.

    (p : G.Walk u v) (q : G.Walk x y) : Prop :=
  Disjoint p.support.tail.dropLast q.support.tail.dropLast

/--
We say a graph is infinitely connected if any two vertices are connected by infinitely many
pairwise disjoint paths.

  Pairwise fun u v ↦ ∃ P : Set (G.Walk u v),

/--
Does every graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ contain a countable subgraph which is
infinitely connected?
