`n` is a *solution* if `n ∈ [p_{k-1}, p_k)` for some `k` (with the convention `p_0 = 1`, where
`p_1 = 2 < p_2 < ⋯` are the primes) and the only primes dividing `n! + 1` are `p_k` and
`p_{k+1}`. Primes are indexed from `0` by `Nat.nth Nat.Prime`.

def IsSolution (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  0 < n ∧ ∃ k : ℕ, (if k = 0 then 1 else nth Nat.Prime (k - 1)) ≤ n ∧
    n < nth Nat.Prime k ∧
      ∀ r : ℕ, r.Prime → r ∣ n ! + 1 → r = nth Nat.Prime k ∨ r = nth Nat.Prime (k + 1)

Let $2=p_1<p_2<\cdots$ be the sequence of prime numbers. Are there only finitely many $n$ such
that $n\in [p_{k-1},p_k)$ and the only primes dividing $n!+1$ are $p_{k}$ and $p_{k+1}$?

A conjecture of Erdős and Stewart, as reported in problem A2 of Guy's collection [Gu04]. The only
known cases are $n=1,2,3,4,5$. Luca [Lu01] proved that indeed these are the only solutions.
