The set $A = \left\{ \sum_{n\in S}n! : S\subset \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}\text{ finite}\right\}$ of all
finite sums of distinct factorials. The indices are positive because $0! = 1!$, so allowing $0$
would count the value $1$ twice.

For each $k \geq 2$, does the set $A = \left\{ \sum_{n\in S}n! : S\subset \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}\text{ finite}\right\}$ of all finite sums of distinct factorials contain only finitely many $k$-th powers?

Does the set $A = \left\{ \sum_{n\in S}n! : S\subset \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}\text{ finite}\right\}$ of all finite sums of distinct factorials contain only finitely many powerful numbers
