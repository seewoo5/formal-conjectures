Let $r\geq 3$ and $k$ be sufficiently large in terms of $r$. Is it true that every $r$-uniform
hypergraph with chromatic number $k$ has at least
$$\binom{(r-1)(k-1)+1}{r}$$
edges, with equality only for the complete graph on $(r-1)(k-1)+1$ vertices?

This was disproved by Alon [Al85]. The validity of this conjecture for $r=3$ remains open.
