Call a sequence $1< X_1\leq \cdots \leq X_m\leq n$ block-compatible if there is a pairwise balanced
block design $A_1,\ldots,A_m\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\lvert A_i\rvert=X_i$ for $1\leq
i\leq m$. (A pairwise block design means that every pair in $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is contained in exactly
one of the $A_i$.) Are there necessary and sufficient conditions for $(X_i)$ to be block-compatible?
Is there some constant $c>0$ such that for all large $n$ there are
$$\geq \exp(c n^{1/2}\log n)$$
many block-compatible sequences for $\{1,\ldots,n\}$?

Is there some constant $c>0$ such that for all large $n$ there are at least
$\exp(c n^{1/2}\log n)$ block-compatible sequences?

Alon has proved there are at least $2^{(\frac{1}{2}+o(1))n^{1/2}\log n}$ many sequences
which are block-compatible for $n$.
