Is it true that for every $\epsilon>0$ and integer $t\geq 1$, if $N$ is sufficiently large and
$A$ is a subset of $[t]^N$ of size at least $\epsilon t^N$ then $A$ must contain a combinatorial
line $P$ (a set $P=\{p_1,\ldots,p_t\}$ where for each coordinate $1\leq j\leq t$ the $j$th
coordinate of $p_i$ is either $i$ or constant).

The 'density Hales-Jewett' problem. This was proved by Furstenberg and Katznelson [FuKa91]. A
new elementary proof, which gives quantitative bounds, was proved by the Polymath project
[Po12].

Combinatorial lines are Mathlib's `Combinatorics.Line (Fin t) (Fin N)` (which have at least one
non-constant coordinate).
