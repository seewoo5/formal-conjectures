Let $p$ be an odd prime. Is it true that the equation $(p-1)!+a^{p-1}=p^k$ has only finitely many
solutions?

Originally proposed by Erdős and Graham [ErGr80].
Brindza and Erdős [BrEr91] proved that there are finitely many such solutions.

    Set.Finite { x : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | let (a, k, p) := x; p.Prime ∧ Odd p ∧
      Nat.factorial (p - 1) + a ^ (p - 1) = p ^ k} := by

Erdős and Graham [ErGr80] ask this allowing $p=2$, but this is presumably an oversight, since clearly
there are infinitely many solutions when $p=2$.

Observe that this creates $1! + a = 2^k$. For all $k$, fix $a = 2^k - 1$.

Yu and Liu [YuLi96] showed that the only solutions to $(p-1)! + a^(p-1) = p^k$
for an odd prime p are:
$$
2! + 1^2 = 3\\
2! + 5^2 = 3^3\\
4! + 1^4 = 5^2
$$
