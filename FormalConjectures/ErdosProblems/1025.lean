Let $f$ be a function from all pairs of elements in $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ to $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such
that $f(x,y)\neq x$ and $\neq y$ for all $x,y$. We call $X\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ independent
if whenever $x,y\in X$ we have $f(x,y)\not\in X$.

Let $g(n)$ be such that, in every function $f$, there is an independent set of size at least
$g(n)$. Estimate $g(n)$.

A question of Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa58], who could prove $n^{1/3} \ll g(n) \ll (n\log n)^{1/2}$.
Spencer [Sp72] proved $g(n)\gg n^{1/2}$. Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov [CFS16] proved
$g(n)\ll n^{1/2}$.
