Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and for each $n \in A$ choose some
$X_n \subseteq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. Let
$B = \{m \in \mathbb{N} : m \not\in X_n \pmod{n} \text{ for all } n \in A \text{ with } m > n\}$.
Must $B$ have a logarithmic density?

The set $A$ is encoded by taking $X_n = \emptyset$ for $n \notin A$. Only positive moduli
$n$ are considered, since $\mathbb{Z}/0\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}$ would allow $B$ to be an
arbitrary set.

The answer is no: Wang [Wa26] (with GPT-5.6) constructed a congruence system whose survivor set
$B$ has lower logarithmic density at most $177/200$ and upper logarithmic density at least
$49/50$. The first linked formal proof establishes this for the real-cutoff normalisation
$\frac{1}{\log x}\sum_{m < x, m \in B} \frac{1}{m}$ with the moduli restricted to $A$; the
second derives the statement below (`Set.HasLogDensity`, all moduli) from it.

theorem erdos_486 : answer(False) ↔
    ∀ X : (n : ℕ) → Set (ZMod n),
      ∃ d, {m : ℕ | ∀ n, 0 < n → n < m → (m : ZMod n) ∉ X n}.HasLogDensity d := by
