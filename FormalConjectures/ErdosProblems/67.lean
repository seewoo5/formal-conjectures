**The Erdős discrepancy problem**

If $f\colon \mathbb N \rightarrow \{-1, +1\}$ then is it true that for every $C>0$ there
exist $d, m \ge 1$ such that $$\left\lvert \sum_{1\leq k\leq m}f(kd)\right\rvert > C?$$
This is true, and was proved by Tao [Ta16]

**The Erdős discrepancy problem (complex variant)**

If $f\colon \mathbb N \rightarrow S^1 ⊆ ℂ$ then is it true that for every $C>0$ there
exist $d, m \ge 1$ such that $$\left\lvert \sum_{1\leq k\leq m}f(kd)\right\rvert > C?$$
This is true, and was proved by Tao [Ta16]
