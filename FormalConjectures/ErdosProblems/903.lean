Let $n=p^2+p+1$ for some prime power $p$, and let $A_1,\ldots,A_t\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a
block design (so that every pair $x,y\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ is contained in exactly one $A_i$). Is it
true that if $t>n$ then $t\geq n+p$?

This is true, and was proved by Erdős, Fowler, Sós, and Wilson [EFSW85].
