Let $r\geq 3$. For an $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$ let $\tau(G)$ denote the covering number (or
transversal number), the minimum size of a set of vertices which includes at least one from each
edge in $G$. Determine the best possible $t$ such that, if $G$ is an $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$
where every subgraph $G'$ on at most $3r-3$ vertices has $\tau(G')\leq 1$, we have $\tau(G)\leq t$.
