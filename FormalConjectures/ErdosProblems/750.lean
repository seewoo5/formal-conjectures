Vertices of the generalised Mycielskian $M_s(G)$: $s$ copies of the vertices of $G$, one per
level, and a single apex.

/--
Adjacency of the generalised Mycielskian, before `SimpleGraph.fromRel` packages it as a graph.

Two level-`0` vertices are adjacent when the underlying vertices are; a level-`i` vertex and a
level-`i + 1` vertex are adjacent when the underlying vertices are; and the apex is adjacent to
every vertex on the top level. The relation is already symmetric and irreflexive, so `fromRel`
changes nothing about it.

The **generalised Mycielskian** $M_s(G)$. $M_2(G)$ is the classical Mycielskian, and $M_1(G)$
adds a vertex joined to everything.

`G` belongs to the class $M_r$, meaning it is built from $K_2$ by $r - 2$ generalised
Mycielskians. Stiebitz's theorem is about this class and not about arbitrary graphs: it is false
that $\chi(M_s(H)) = \chi(H) + 1$ for every $H$ and every $s$.

/--
**Stiebitz's theorem** [St85]: every graph in $M_r$ has chromatic number at least $r$. The
matching upper bound follows from the construction, so the chromatic number is exactly $r$.

This is stated ahead of `erdos_750` because the formal proof linked there assumes it, and the
`assuming` clause must name a declaration that already exists. See also [SaSt89] and [MuSt19].

Let $f(m)$ be some function such that $f(m)\to \infty$ as $m\to \infty$. Does there exist a
graph $G$ of infinite chromatic number such that every subgraph on $m$ vertices contains
an independent set of size at least $\frac{m}{2}-f(m)$?

Note that in [Er94b] the function $f$ generalises a (proven) result for $f(m) = \epsilon m$,
where $\epsilon > 0$. Hence we should assume it is non-negative valued.

The existence of such a graph was proved [UlamErdos750] by GPT 5.5 Pro (prompted by Chojecki).
Indeed, this constructs a graph with infinite chromatic number such that every subgraph on $m$
vertices can be made bipartite after deleting at most $f(m)$ many vertices.

This was formalized in Lean by Ammanamanchi using Claude Code 4.7 and GPT-5.5 Pro.

The linked proof is not complete on its own. It declares Stiebitz's theorem as an axiom and
derives the result from it, so it is marked `conditional` and names
`erdos_750.variants.stiebitz`.

In [Er69b] Erdős conjectures this for $f(m)=\epsilon m$ for any fixed $\epsilon>0$. This follows
from a result of Erdős, Hajnal, and Szemerédi [EHS82], as described by Sellke in the comments.
