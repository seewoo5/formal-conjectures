/--
For integer $n \geq 1$ we define the factor difference set of $n$ by
$D(n) = \{|a-b| : n=ab\}$.

def factorDifferenceSet (n : ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  {d | ∃ a b : ℕ, n = a * b ∧ (d : ℤ) = |(a : ℤ) - b|}

/--
Is it true that, for every $k \geq 1$, there exist integers $N_1 < \dots < N_k$ such that
$|\cap_i D(N_i)| \geq k$?
