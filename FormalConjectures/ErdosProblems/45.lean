Let $k\geq 2$. Is there an integer $n_k$ such that, if $D=\{ 1<d<n_k : d\mid n_k\}$, then for any
$k$-colouring of $D$ there is a monochromatic subset $D'\subseteq D$ such that
$\sum_{d\in D'}\frac{1}{d}=1$?

This follows from the colouring result of Croot [Cr03]. Croot's result allows for
$n_k \leq e^{C^k}$ for some constant $C>1$ (simply taking $n_k$ to be the lowest common multiple of
some interval $[1,C^k]$). Sawhney has observed that there is also a doubly exponential lower bound,
and hence this bound is essentially sharp.
