Does there exist a $3$-critical $3$-uniform hypergraph in which every vertex has degree
$\geq 7$, where criticality means that the transversal number is $3$ and deleting any edge
reduces it to $2$?

In the first formulation, the transversal notion of criticality, Li [Li25] proves that a
$3$-critical $3$-uniform hypergraph must have a vertex of degree $\leq 6$.

Does there exist a $3$-critical $3$-uniform hypergraph with minimum degree at least $7$,
where criticality means that deleting any edge or vertex reduces chromatic number $3$ to $2$?

In the second formulation, the chromatic notion of criticality, Li [Li25] provides an
explicit $3$-critical $3$-uniform hypergraph on $9$ vertices with minimum degree $7$.
