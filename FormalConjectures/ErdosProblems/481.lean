For a finite sequence of $n$ (not necessarily distinct) integers $A = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, the
sequence `T a b A` of length $rn$ given by $(a_ix_j+b_i)_{1\leq j\leq n, 1\leq i\leq r}$.

/--
Let $a_1,\ldots,a_r,b_1,\ldots,b_r\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\sum_{i}\frac{1}{a_i}>1$. For any
finite sequence of $n$ (not necessarily distinct) integers $A=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ let $T(A)$ denote
the sequence of length $rn$ given by
$$(a_ix_j+b_i)_{1\leq j\leq n, 1\leq i\leq r}.$$
Prove that, if $A_1=(1)$ and $A_{i+1}=T(A_i)$, then there must be some $A_k$ with repeated
elements.

This is true. This appears to have first been shown by Klarner [Kl82], with a generalisation
given by Kolpakov and Talambutsa [KoTa22]. Essentially the same proof was found independently by
Barreto in the comment section.
