How large should $\ell(n)$ be such that, almost surely, a random $3$-uniform hypergraph on $3n$
vertices with $\ell(n)$ edges must contain $n$ vertex-disjoint edges?

The precise asymptotic was given by Kahn [Ka23], proving that the threshold is $\sim n\log n$ (also
for the general problem over $r$-uniform hypergraphs).

theorem erdos_747 :
    let threshold : ℕ → ℝ := answer(fun n : ℕ ↦ n * Real.log n)
    ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ε < 1 →
    Tendsto (fun n ↦ Hypergraph.matchingProbability (3 * n) 3
      ⌊(1 + ε) * threshold n⌋₊ n) atTop (𝓝 1) ∧
    Tendsto (fun n ↦ Hypergraph.matchingProbability (3 * n) 3
      ⌊(1 - ε) * threshold n⌋₊ n) atTop (𝓝 0) := by
