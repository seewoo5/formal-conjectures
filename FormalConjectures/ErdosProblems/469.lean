/--
Let $A$ be the set of all $n$ such that $n = d_1 + ⋯ + d_k$ with $d_i$ distinct
proper divisors of $n$, but this is not true for any $m ∣ n$ with $m < n$. Does:
$$
  \sum_{n ∈ A} \frac 1 n
$$
converge?

Yes: the sum converges. This was proved by Lewis [Le25], whose proof has been formalized in
Lean.
