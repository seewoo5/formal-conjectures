Let $f(n;t)$ be minimal such that if a $t$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices contains at least
$f(n;t)$ edges then there must be four edges $A,B,C,D$ such that
$$A\cup B= C\cup D$$
and
$$A\cap B=C\cap D=\emptyset.$$
Estimate $f(n;t)$ - in particular, is it true that for $t\geq 3$
$$f(n;t)=(1+o(1))\binom{n}{t-1}?$$

Is it true that $f(n;t)=(1+o(1))\binom{n}{t-1}$ for $t\geq 3$?
