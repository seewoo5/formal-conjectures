Let $E\subset (0,\infty)$ be a set of positive measure. Is it true that, for almost all $x>0$,
for all sufficiently large (depending on $x$) integers $n$ there exists an integer $r\geq 1$ such
that $nx\in r\cdot E$?

A problem of Haight, who constructed a set $E\subset (0,\infty)$ of infinite measure such that,
for all $x\in E$, $x\not\in r\cdot E$ if $r\geq 2$, and also for all $x>0$, if $n$ is large enough
then $nx\not\in E$ (see [1195](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1195)).

This is trivially true if $E$ contains an interval $(a,b)$ with $a<b$, since for any $x>0$, for
all large $n$, the interval $(\frac{nx}{b},\frac{nx}{a})$ has length $>1$ so contains at least
one integer $r\geq 1$.

Buczolich and Mauldin [BuMa99] proved that there exists an open set $E\subset (0,\infty)$ and two
intervals $I,J\subset [1/2,1)$ such that, for all $x\in I$, $x\in \frac{1}{n}\cdot E$ for
infinitely many $n\geq 1$, and for almost all $x\in J$, $x\not\in \frac{1}{n}\cdot E$ for all
sufficiently large (depending on $x$) $n$.

This was solved in the negative by ebarschkis in the comments, who constructed a counterexample
using a variant of the Buczolich-Mauldin construction.
