Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be such that $f(x+h)-f(x)$ is continuous for every $h>0$. Is it
true that
$$f=g+h$$
for some continuous $g$ and additive $h$ (i.e. $h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)$)?

A conjecture of Erdős from the early 1950s. Answered in the affirmative by de Bruijn [dB51].

theorem erdos_907 : answer(True) ↔
    ∀ f : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ h : ℝ, 0 < h → Continuous fun x => f (x + h) - f x) →
