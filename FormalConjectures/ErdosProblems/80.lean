  `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/600.lean`

600 asks the same question from the other side. `Erdos600.eFunction n r` is the least edge
count forcing some edge into `r` triangles; `f c n` here is the largest book forced once the
edge count is at least $cn^2$. So `r ≤ f c n` and `Erdos600.eFunction n r ≤ c * n^2` say the
same thing, and the two functions are inverse to each other in that sense. Both are built on
`SimpleGraph.trianglesContaining`, which 600 introduced.

/-- $f_c(n)$, the largest book size forced on every admissible graph, which is the least book
number among them.

`sInf` of the empty set is `0`, so `f c n = 0` when no graph on `n` vertices has $cn^2$ edges
at all. A simple graph has at most $n(n-1)/2$ edges, so that happens for every `n` once
$c \geq 1/2$. The statements below therefore restrict `c` to the feasible range; without that
they are false at, say, `c = 2` for reasons unrelated to the question. -/
noncomputable def f (c : ℝ) (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sInf {m | ∃ G : SimpleGraph (Fin n), Admissible c G ∧ bookNumber G = m}

/--
Let $c>0$ and let $f_c(n)$ be the maximal $m$ such that every graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and
at least $cn^2$ edges, where each edge is contained in at least one triangle, must contain a
book of size $m$, that is, an edge shared by at least $m$ different triangles. Estimate
$f_c(n)$. In particular, is it true that $f_c(n)>n^\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon>0$?

The bound $c < 1/2$ is what makes the hypothesis satisfiable: a simple graph on $n$ vertices
has at most $n(n-1)/2$ edges, so no graph has $cn^2$ of them once $c \geq 1/2$.

The weaker question from the same problem: is $f_c(n) \gg \log n$?

Same feasibility bound on `c` as above.
