A pairwise balanced design for $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is a collection of sets $A_1,\ldots,A_m\subseteq
\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $2\leq \lvert A_i\rvert <n$ and every pair of distinct elements $x,y\in
\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is contained in exactly one $A_i$. Is there a constant $C>0$ and, for all large $n$,
a pairwise balanced design such that
$$\lvert A_i\rvert > n^{1/2}-C$$
for all $1\leq i\leq m$?
