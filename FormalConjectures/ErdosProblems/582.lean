A graph `G` is *edge-Ramsey for triangles* (in arrow notation, $G \to (K_3, K_3)^e$) if any
$2$-colouring of the edges of `G` produces a monochromatic $K_3$: three pairwise adjacent
vertices whose three connecting edges all receive the same colour.

  ∀ c : G.edgeSet → Fin 2,
    ∃ (u v w : V) (huv : G.Adj u v) (hvw : G.Adj v w) (huw : G.Adj u w),
      c ⟨s(u, v), huv⟩ = c ⟨s(v, w), hvw⟩ ∧ c ⟨s(v, w), hvw⟩ = c ⟨s(u, w), huw⟩

/--
Does there exist a graph $G$ which contains no $K_4$, and yet any $2$-colouring of the edges
produces a monochromatic $K_3$?

Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa67] first asked for the existence of any such graph. Existence was proved
by Folkman [Fo70], but with very poor quantitative bounds. (As a result these quantities are
often called Folkman numbers.) The current best bounds on the minimal number of vertices $N$ of
such a graph are $21 \leq N \leq 786$, where the lower bound is due to Bikov and Nenov [BiNe20]
and the upper bound is due to Lange, Radziszowski, and Xu [LRX14].
