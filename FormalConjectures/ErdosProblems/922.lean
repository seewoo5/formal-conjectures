Let $k\geq 0$. Let $G$ be a graph such that every subgraph $H$ contains an independent set of size
$\geq (n-k)/2$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $H$. Must $G$ have chromatic number at most
$k+2$?

A question of Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa67b]. The case $k=0$ is trivial, but they could not prove
this even for $k=1$.

This is true, and was proved by Folkman [Fo70b].
