Is it true that, for all sufficiently large $n$, there exists some $k$ such that
\[
p(n+k)>k^2+1,
\]
where $p(m)$ denotes the least prime factor of $m$?

theorem erdos_680 :
    answer(sorry) ↔ ∀ᶠ (n : ℕ) in .atTop, ∃ k ≠ 0, (n + k).minFac > k^2 + 1 := sorry

/--
Can one prove this is false if we replace $k^2+1$ by $e^{(1+\epsilon)\sqrt{k}}+C_\epsilon$, for all
$\epsilon>0$, where $C_\epsilon>0$ is some constant?
