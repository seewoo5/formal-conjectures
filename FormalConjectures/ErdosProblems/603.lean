Let $(A_i)$ be a family of countably infinite sets such that $\lvert A_i\cap A_j\rvert \neq 2$ for
all $i\neq j$. Find the smallest cardinal $C$ such that $\cup A_i$ can always be coloured with at
most $C$ colours so that no $A_i$ is monochromatic.

GPT 5.4 Pro (prompted by Chojecki) proved there is no uniform bound on such $C$: for every cardinal
$C$ there is a family of countably infinite sets $(A_i)$ such that $\lvert A_i\cap A_j\rvert \neq 2$
for all $i\neq j$, and in any colouring of $\cup A_i$ with $C$ colours some $A_i$ is monochromatic.

theorem erdos_603 :
    ∀ C : Cardinal.{0}, ∃ (V : Type) (F : Set (Set V)),
    (∀ A ∈ F, Cardinal.mk A = ℵ₀) ∧
    F.Pairwise (fun (A B : Set V) ↦ Cardinal.mk ↥(A ∩ B) ≠ 2) ∧
    ⋃₀ F = Set.univ ∧
    ∀ c : V → C.out, ∃ A ∈ F, ∀ x ∈ A, ∀ y ∈ A, c x = c y := by
