/-- `F k` is the number of solutions to $1 = \frac{1}{n_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_k}$ with
$1 \leq n_1 < \cdots < n_k$, that is, the number of $k$-element sets of positive integers whose
reciprocals sum to $1$. -/

/-- The sequence $u_0 = 1$, $u_{n+1} = u_n(u_n + 1)$ of [ElPl21, Corollary 3]:
$1, 2, 6, 42, 1806, \ldots$, a shifted copy of Sylvester's sequence. This is the sequence
`Erdos315.u` of Erdős Problem 315. -/
def u : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 1
  | n + 1 => u n * (u n + 1)

/-- The constant $c_0 = \lim_{n \to \infty} u_n^{2^{-n}} = 1.5979102\ldots$ of
[ElPl21, Corollary 3]. The sequence $u_n^{2^{-n}}$ is increasing and bounded by $2$
[ElPl21, Remark 3], so the limit is its supremum. This constant is the square of the Vardi
constant $1.26408\ldots$, which is `Erdos315.c₀`. -/

Let $F(k)$ be the number of solutions to
$$ 1= \frac{1}{n_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n_k},$$
where $1\leq n_1<\cdots<n_k$ are distinct integers. Find good estimates for $F(k)$.

/--
The current best bounds known are
$$2^{c^{\frac{k}{\log k}}}\leq F(k) \leq c_0^{(\frac{1}{5}+o(1))2^k},$$
where $c>0$ is some absolute constant and $c_0=1.5979102\ldots$ is the square of the 'Vardi
constant' $1.26408\cdots$. The lower bound is due to Konyagin [Ko14] and the upper bound to
Elsholtz and Planitzer [ElPl21]. (erdosproblems.com gives $c_0=1.26408\cdots$;
[ElPl21, Remark 3] gives $c_0=1.5979102\ldots$.)

[Ko14, Theorem 1] states the lower bound in the explicit form
$$F(k) \geq \exp\left(\exp\left(\left(\frac{(\log 2)(\log 3)}{3}+o(1)\right)
\frac{k}{\log k}\right)\right) \quad (k \to \infty),$$
which is the statement formalised here.

[ElPl21, Corollary 3(2)] shows that for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and all $k \geq k(\varepsilon)$,
the number $f_k(1,1) \geq F(k)$ of solutions with $n_1 \leq \cdots \leq n_k$ is less than
$c_0^{(\frac{2}{5}+\varepsilon)2^{k-1}} = c_0^{(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{\varepsilon}{2})2^k}$.
