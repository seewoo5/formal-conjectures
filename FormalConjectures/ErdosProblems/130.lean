Let $A\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be an infinite set which contains no three points on a
line and no four points on a circle. Consider the graph with vertices the points
in $A$, where two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if they are an
integer distance apart. How large can the chromatic number and clique number of
this graph be? In particular, can the chromatic number be infinite?

The chromatic number can be infinite: there is an infinite general-position set
whose integer-distance graph admits no finite proper colouring. How large the
*clique* number can be is not addressed here.
