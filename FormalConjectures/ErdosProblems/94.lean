Suppose $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ determine a convex polygon and the set of distances between
them is $\{u_1,\ldots,u_t\}$. Suppose $u_i$ appears as the distance between $f(u_i)$ many pairs of
points. Then
$$\sum_i f(u_i)^2 \ll n^3.$$

In [Er97c] Erdős claims that Fishburn solved this, but gives no reference.

Note it is trivial that $\sum f(u_i)=\binom{n}{2}$.

Lefmann and Theile [LeTh95] prove a stronger version of this question, that
$$\sum_i f(u_i)^2 \ll n^3$$
under the weaker assumption that no three points are on a line.

Erdős and Fishburn also make the stronger conjecture that $\sum f(u_i)^2$ is maximal for the
regular $n$-gon (for large enough $n$).
