Let $\alpha\in[0,1/2)$ and $n,t\geq 1$. Let $F^{(t)}(n,\alpha)$ be the smallest $m$ such that we can
$2$-colour the edges of the complete $t$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices such that if $X\subseteq
[n]$ with $\lvert X\rvert \geq m$ then there are at least $\alpha \binom{\lvert X\rvert}{t}$ many
$t$-subsets of $X$ of each colour. For fixed $n,t$ as we change $\alpha$ from $0$ to $1/2$ does
$F^{(t)}(n,\alpha)$ increase continuously or are there jumps? Only one jump?

Here growth is compared up to constant factors as $n\to\infty$. At $\alpha=0$,
each color must occur, following the source's Ramsey convention.

For fixed $t\geq 3$, do all positive densities below $1/2$ give the same asymptotic order?
