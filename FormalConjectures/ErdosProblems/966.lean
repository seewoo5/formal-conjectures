Let $k,r\geq 2$. Does there exist a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ that contains no non-trivial
arithmetic progression of length $k+1$, yet in any $r$-colouring of $A$ there must exist a
monochromatic non-trivial arithmetic progression of length $k$?

Erdős [Er75b] reported that 'Spencer has recently shown that such a sequence exists', but gives
no reference.
