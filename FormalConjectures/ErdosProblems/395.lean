If $z_1,\ldots,z_n\in \mathbb{C}$ with $\lvert z_i\rvert=1$ then is it true that the probability
that
$$\lvert \epsilon_1z_1+\cdots+\epsilon_nz_n\rvert \leq \sqrt{2},$$
where $\epsilon_i\in \{-1,1\}$ uniformly at random, is $\gg 1/n$?

A reverse Littlewood-Offord problem. Erdős originally asked this with $\sqrt{2}$ replaced by $1$,
but Carnielli and Carolino [CaCa11] observed that this is false, choosing $z_1=1$ and $z_k=i$
for $2\leq k\leq n$, where $n$ is even, since then the sum is at least $\sqrt{2}$ always.

Solved in the affirmative by He, Juškevičius, Narayanan, and Spiro [HJNS24]. The bound of $1/n$
is the best possible, as shown by taking $z_k=1$ for $1\leq k\leq n/2$ and $z_k=i$ otherwise.
