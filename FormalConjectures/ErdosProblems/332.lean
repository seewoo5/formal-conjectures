The set of numbers $D(A)$ which occur infinitely often as $a_1 - a_2$ with $a_1, a_2 \in A$.

A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ has bounded gaps if it is syndetic, meaning there is a uniform
bound $M$ such that every interval of length $M$ contains an element of $S$.

  ∃ M : ℕ, M > 0 ∧ ∀ z : ℤ, ∃ s ∈ S, z ≤ s ∧ s < z + (M : ℤ)

/--
Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $D(A)$ be the set of those numbers which occur infinitely often as
$a_1 - a_2$ with $a_1, a_2\in A$. What conditions on $A$ are sufficient to ensure $D(A)$ has bounded
gaps?

This is formalised here using the `answer(sorry)` mechanism. In order to solve this problem one
has to provide what the sufficient conditions are, and proof that they imply the desired condition.
If the condition is a solution to the problem is up to human judgement.
