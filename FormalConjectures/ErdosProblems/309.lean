Let $N\geq 1$. How many integers can be written as the sum of distinct unit fractions with
denominators from $\{1,\ldots,N\}$? Are there $o(\log N)$ such integers?

If the number of such integers is $N(n)$ then it is trivial that $N(n)\leq \log n+O(1)$. Yokota
[Yo97] proved that $N(n)\geq \log n-O(\log\log n)$.

Croot [Cr99] proved that every integer at most
$$\leq \sum_{n\leq N}\frac{1}{n}-(\tfrac{9}{2}+o(1))\frac{(\log\log N)^2}{\log N}$$
can be so represented.

If $F(N)$ counts the number of integers which can be represented in this fashion, then the
current best lower bound known is
$$F(N) \geq \log N+\gamma -\left(\frac{\pi^2}{3}+o(1)\right)\frac{(\log\log N)^2}{\log N}$$
due to Yokota [Yo02].

The answer to the question is no: $F(N) \sim \log N$. Here $0$ (the empty sum) is counted.
