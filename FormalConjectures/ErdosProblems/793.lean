/--
Let $F(n)$ be the maximum possible size of a subset $A \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that
$a \nmid bc$ whenever $a, b, c \in A$ with $a \neq b$ and $a \neq c$. Is there a constant $c$ such
that
$$F(n) = \pi(n) + (c + o(1)) n^{2/3} (\log n)^{-2}?$$

A problem of Erdős [Er69, Er70b], who proved in [Er38] that
$F(n) = \pi(n) + O(n^{2/3} (\log n)^{-2})$. The answer is yes, with $c = 27/2$: this was proved by
GPT-5.6 Sol (prompted by Chojecki), refining the argument of [Er38]; see
`erdos_793.variants.constant`.

The constant in Problem 793 is $c = 27/2$, i.e.
$$F(n) = \pi(n) + \left(\frac{27}{2} + o(1)\right) \frac{n^{2/3}}{(\log n)^2}.$$
Formalised by van Doorn and Aristotle, following the proof of GPT-5.6 Sol.
