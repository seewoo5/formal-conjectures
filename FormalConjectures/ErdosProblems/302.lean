A finite set $A$ of positive integers admits no solution to
$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}$ with $a, b, c$ distinct elements of $A$.

def NoUnitFractionTriple (A : Finset ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a ∈ A, ∀ b ∈ A, ∀ c ∈ A, a ≠ b → a ≠ c → b ≠ c →
    (1 : ℚ) / a ≠ (1 : ℚ) / b + (1 : ℚ) / c

/--
$f N$ is the size of the largest $A ⊆ \{1, …, N\}$ containing no solution to
$\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}$ with distinct $a, b, c ∈ A$.

def IsMaxNoTripleCard (N m : ℕ) : Prop :=
  IsGreatest {k | ∃ A ⊆ Finset.Icc 1 N, NoUnitFractionTriple A ∧ A.card = k} m

/--
Let $f(N)$ be the size of the largest $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ such that there are no
solutions to
$$\frac{1}{a}= \frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}$$
with distinct $a,b,c\in A$? Estimate $f(N)$.

The colouring version of this is [303], which was solved by Brown and Rödl [BrRo91].

In particular, is $f(N)=(\tfrac{1}{2}+o(1))N$?

This is false: it is contradicted by Cambie's lower bound of $(5/8+o(1))N$ recorded below,
since $5/8 > 1/2$.

One can take either $A$ to be all odd integers in $[1,N]$ or all integers in $[N/2,N]$ to show
$f(N)\geq (1/2+o(1))N$.

Stijn Cambie has observed that
$$f(N)\geq (5/8+o(1))N,$$
taking $A$ to be all odd integers $\leq N/4$ and all integers in $[N/2,N]$.
