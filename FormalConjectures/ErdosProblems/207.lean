For any $g\geq 2$, if $n$ is sufficiently large and $\equiv 1,3\pmod{6}$ then there exists a
3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices such that

- every pair of vertices is contained in exactly one edge (i.e. the graph is a Steiner triple
system) and

- for any $2\leq j\leq g$ any collection of $j$ edges contains at least $j+3$ vertices.

Proved by Kwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin [KSSS22b].

theorem erdos_207 :
    ∀ g : ℕ, 2 ≤ g → ∀ᶠ n : ℕ in atTop,
    n % 6 = 1 ∨ n % 6 = 3 → ∃ H : Finset (Finset (Fin n)),
      H.IsBlockDesign 2 3 ∧ ∀ E ⊆ H,
        2 ≤ E.card → E.card ≤ g → E.card + 3 ≤ (E.biUnion id).card := by
  sorry
