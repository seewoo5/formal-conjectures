Find, for all large $n$, a non-trivial pairwise balanced block design $A_1,\ldots,A_m\subseteq
\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that, for all $t$, there are $O(n^{1/2})$ many $i$ such that $\lvert
A_i\rvert=t$.

theorem erdos_734 :
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ᶠ n : ℕ in atTop,
    ∃ H : Finset (Finset (Fin n)), H.IsPairwiseBalancedDesign ∧
      (∀ e ∈ H, e.card < n) ∧ ∀ t : ℕ,
        ({e ∈ H | e.card = t}.card : ℝ) ≤ C * Real.sqrt n := by
