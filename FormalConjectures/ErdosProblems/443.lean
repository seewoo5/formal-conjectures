The set $\{k(m-k) : 1\leq k\leq m/2\}$, where `m / 2` is `ℕ` floor division.

def A (m : ℕ) : Finset ℕ := (Finset.Icc 1 (m / 2)).image fun k => k * (m - k)

Let $m,n\geq 1$. What is
$$\# \{ k(m-k) : 1\leq k\leq m/2\} \cap \{ l(n-l) : 1\leq l\leq n/2\}?$$
Can it be arbitrarily large?

This was solved independently by Hegyvári [He25] and Cambie (unpublished), who show that if
$m>n$ then the set in question has size
$$\leq m^{O(1/\log\log m)},$$
and that for any integer $s$ there exist infinitely many pairs $(m,n)$ such that the set in
question has size $s$.

Let $m,n\geq 1$. What is
$$\# \{ k(m-k) : 1\leq k\leq m/2\} \cap \{ l(n-l) : 1\leq l\leq n/2\}?$$
Is it $\leq (mn)^{o(1)}$ for all sufficiently large $m,n$?

This was solved independently by Hegyvári [He25] and Cambie (unpublished), who show that if
$m>n$ then the set in question has size
$$\leq m^{O(1/\log\log m)},$$
