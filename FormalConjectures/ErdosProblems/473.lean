Is there a permutation $a_1, a_2, \ldots$ of the positive integers such that $a_k + a_{k+1}$ is
always prime?

A question of Segal [ErGr80, p.94]. The answer is yes, as shown by Odlyzko. The linked formal
proof (Codex and GPT-5.6 Sol) builds the permutation as a spanning one-way ray of the graph on the
positive integers in which two numbers are adjacent when their sum is prime.

Segal also asked whether for every $n \ge 2$ there is a permutation $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ of
$\{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that $a_k + a_{k+1}$ is prime for all $1 \le k < n$. This is conjectured to
be true, and has been verified for infinitely many $n$.
