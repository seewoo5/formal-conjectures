If $G$ is bipartite then $\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\ll n^{3/2}$ if and only $G$ is $2$-degenerate, that
is, $G$ contains no induced subgraph with minimal degree at least 3.

Conjectured by Erdős and Simonovits [ErSi84]. Erdős first offered \$250 for a proof and \$100 for
a counterexample, but in [Er93] offered \$500 for a counterexample. Disproved by Janzer [Ja23b]
who constructed, for any $\epsilon>0$, a $3$-regular bipartite graph $H$ such that
$$\mathrm{ex}(n;H)\ll n^{\frac{4}{3}+\epsilon}.$$

See also [146](https://www.erdosproblems.com/146) and [147](https://www.erdosproblems.com/147).

The linked formal proof refutes the "only if" direction via Janzer's construction.
