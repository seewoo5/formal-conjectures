/- ## The two external inputs

The formal proof linked on `erdos_1141` below assumes both of these, and states neither. They are
recorded here so the `assuming` clause on that theorem can name them. -/

noncomputable def residuePrimeUpperBound (m : ℕ) (ε : ℝ) : ℝ := (m : ℝ) ^ ((1 / 4 : ℝ) + ε)

/--
The primes $\ell \leq m^{1/4+\varepsilon}$ with $\chi(\ell) = 1$.

This does not require $\chi$ to be quadratic. That hypothesis belongs to the theorem below, as it
does in the paper.

**Theorem 1.3 of [Po17]**: for a quadratic character to a large enough modulus, the primes below
$m^{1/4+\varepsilon}$ on which the character is $1$ outnumber any fixed power of $\log m$.

/--
**Mertens' third theorem** [Me1874], in the weakened form the linked proof assumes: the product
over the primes up to $n$ of $1 - 1/p$ is at least $1/(3\log n)$.

The true asymptotic is $e^{-\gamma}/\log n$, and $e^{-\gamma} > 1/3$, so this bound is weaker than
the theorem and is what the deduction needs.

/--
Are there infinitely many $n$ such that $n-k^2$ is prime for all $k$ with $(n,k)=1$ and $k^2 < n$?

In [Va99] it is asked whether $968$ is the largest integer with this property, but this is an
error, since for example $968-9=7\cdot 137$.

The list of $n$ satisfying the given property is [A214583] in the OEIS. The largest known such $n$
is $1722$.

The answer is negative: [APSSV26b] proves a stronger finiteness theorem, deducing it from
Pollack [Po17]. Oriike [Or26] formalised the deduction in Lean.

The linked proof is the deduction and not the whole result. It declares Theorem 1.3 of [Po17] and
Mertens' third theorem as axioms, so it is marked `conditional` and names both.
