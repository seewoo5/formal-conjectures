For a triangle-free graph $G$ let $h_2(G)$ be the smallest number of edges that need to be
added to $G$ so that it has diameter $2$ and is still triangle-free. Is it true that if $G$
has maximum degree $o(n^{1/2})$ then $h(G)=o(n^2)$?

A problem of Erdős, Gyárfás, and Ruszinkó [EGR98]. Simonovits showed that there exist graphs
$G$ with maximum degree $\gg n^{1/2}$ and $h_2(G)\gg n^2$. Alon has observed this problem is
essentially identical to [134], and his solution in
[this note](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nalon/PDFS/remark1901.pdf) also solves this
problem in the affirmative.
