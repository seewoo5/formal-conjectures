Erdős expected very few solutions for $M(n, k) = M(m, l)$, where $m \geq n + k$ and $l > 1$.
The only solutions he knew were the following.

lemma lcmInterval_eq_example1 : lcmInterval 4 3 = lcmInterval 13 2 ∧
                                lcmInterval 3 4 = lcmInterval 19 2 := by decide

/--
Denote by $M(n, k)$ the least common multiple of the finite set $\{n+1, \dotsc, n+k\}$.
Is it true that for all $m \geq n + k$, we get $M(m, k) \neq M(n, k)$?

theorem erdos_677 :
    ∀ (m n k : ℕ), k > 0 → m ≥ n + k → lcmInterval m k ≠ lcmInterval n k := by
  sorry

-- TODO: Add the other statements from the reference.
