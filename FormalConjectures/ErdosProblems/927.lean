/--
Let $g(n)$ be the maximum number of different sizes of cliques that can occur in a graph on $n$
vertices. Estimate $g(n)$ - in particular, is it true that
$$g(n) = n - \log_2 n - \log_*(n) + O(1),$$
where $\log_*(n)$ is the number of iterated logarithms such that $\log \cdots \log n < 1$?

A quantity first considered by Moon and Moser [MoMo65], who proved
$n - \log_2 n - 2 \log \log n < g(n) \le n - \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$. Erdős [Er66b] improved the
lower bound to $n - \log_2 n - \log_*(n) - O(1) < g(n)$ and conjectured this was the correct order
of magnitude. This was disproved by Spencer [Sp71], who proved that in fact
$g(n) > n - \log_2 n - O(1)$.

Here $\log_2 n$ and $\log_*(n)$ are formalised as `Nat.log 2 n` and `Nat.iteratedLog 2 n`
(iterating `Nat.log 2` until the value is at most `1`); both differ from the quantities in the
problem by $O(1)$, so the statement is unaffected. See also `erdos_775.variants.spencer` and
`erdos_775.variants.moon_moser`.
