Is there an explicit construction of a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $A+A=\mathbb{N}$ but
$1_A\ast 1_A(n)=o(n^\epsilon)$ for every $\epsilon>0$?

The existence of such a set was asked by Sidon to Erdős in 1932. Erdős (eventually) proved the
existence of such a set using probabilistic methods. This problem asks for a constructive
solution. An explicit construction was given by Jain, Pham, Sawhney, and Zakharov [JPSZ24].

The formal statement records the existence of such a set; the linked formal proof exhibits an
explicit construction.
