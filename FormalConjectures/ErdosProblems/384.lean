If $1<k<n-1$ then $\binom{n}{k}$ is divisible by a prime $p\leq n/2$ (except
$\binom{7}{3}=\binom{7}{4}=5\cdot 7$).

A conjecture of Erdős and Selfridge [ErGr80]. Proved by Ecklund [Ec69], who made the stronger
conjecture that whenever $n>k^2$ the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is divisible by a prime
$p<n/k$. Discussed in problem B31 and B33 of Guy's collection [Gu04]. Stronger forms of this
conjecture are [1094](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1094) and
[1095](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1095).

Ecklund's theorem is stated for $n \geq 2k$ with the single exception $\binom{7}{3}$; by the
symmetry $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$ this is the form above, where $\binom{7}{4}$ is the
second exception. The prime bound is $p \leq n/2$ (that is, $2p \leq n$); see
`erdos_384.variants.strict` for the strict inequality.

With the strict inequality $p < n/2$ the statement is false: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ has no prime
divisor $p < 2$.
