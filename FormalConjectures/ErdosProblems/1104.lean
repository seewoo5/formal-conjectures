Lower bound (Hefty–Horn–King–Pfender 2025).
There exists a constant $c_1 \in (0,1]$ such that, for sufficiently large $n$,
$$
c_1 \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}} \le f(n),
$$
where $f(n)$ denotes the maximum chromatic number of a triangle-free graph on
$n$ vertices, formalized as `triangleFreeMaxChromatic n`.

Upper bound (Davies–Illingworth 2022).
There exists a constant $c_2 \ge 2$ such that, for sufficiently large $n$,
$$
f(n) \le c_2 \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}},
$$
where $f(n)$ denotes the maximum chromatic number of a triangle-free graph on
$n$ vertices, formalized as `triangleFreeMaxChromatic n`.
