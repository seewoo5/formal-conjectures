If $A,B,C\in \mathbb{R}^2$ form a triangle and $P$ is a point in the interior then, if $N$ is
where the perpendicular from $P$ to $AB$ meets the triangle, and similarly for $M$ and $L$,
$$
\overline{PA}+\overline{PB}+\overline{PC}\geq 2(\overline{PM}+\overline{PN}+\overline{PL}).
$$

Conjectured by Erdős in 1932 (according to [Er82e]) and proved by Mordell soon afterwards, now
known as the Erdős-Mordell inequality.
