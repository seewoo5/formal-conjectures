Suppose $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ and $C>0$ is such that $1_A\ast 1_A(n)\leq C$ for all
$n\in\mathbb{N}$. Can $A$ be partitioned into $t$ many subsets $A_1,\ldots,A_t$ (where
$t=t(C)$ depends only on $C$) such that $1_{A_i}\ast 1_{A_i}(n)<C$ for all $1\leq i\leq t$
and $n\in \mathbb{N}$?

The answer is no. Asked by Erdős and Newman. Nešetřil and Rödl [NeRo85] have shown the
answer is no for all $C$ (even if $t$ is also allowed to depend on $A$).

Erdős [Er80e] had previously shown the answer is no for $C=3,4$ and infinitely many other
values of $C$.

See also [774].

The linked proof writes the representation function as
`Set.ncard {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 ∈ A ∧ p.2 ∈ A ∧ p.1 + p.2 = n}`, which counts the same ordered
pairs as `sumRep`, and states the partition condition as a named definition with the same two
conjuncts used below. Its `∃ t` additionally carries `1 ≤ t`, which costs nothing: `t = 0`
forces `A = ∅`, and `A = {1}` has all representation counts at most `C` for `C ≥ 1`.
