/-- There exists a proper ideal `I` in a (commutative) total ring `R` of fractions that is an invertible module.
If `I ⊊ R` is such an example, `I` must have infinite order in the Picard group.
Moreover, `R` must not be Noetherian (otherwise it must be semi-local and therefore have trivial Picard group).

The linked formal proof gives the following explicit construction.

Let `D = ℂ[X, Y] / (Y² - X³)` be the coordinate ring of the cuspidal cubic.
Let `P = (X - 1, Y - 1)`, which is an invertible ideal.
Let `M` be the direct sum of the evaluation fibres at cusp parameters `r ≠ 1`.
Form the idealization `R = D ⋉ M`.
The desired ideal is the range of the multiplication map `R ⊗[D] P → R`.
