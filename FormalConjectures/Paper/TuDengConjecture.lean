  commit `3c005614`, theorem `TuDeng.FirstExit.tu_deng_conjecture_full`

For an integer $k \ge 2$, identify the residues modulo $2^k - 1$ with the integers
$0, 1, \dots, 2^k - 2$, and let $w(a)$ denote the binary weight of $a$ (the number of ones in
its binary expansion). The Tu-Deng conjecture states that for every residue $t \ne 0$,

$$\#\{(a, b) : a + b \equiv t \pmod{2^k - 1},\ w(a) + w(b) \le k - 1\} \le 2^{k-1}.$$

Tu and Deng showed that this combinatorial statement implies that their constructions of
Boolean functions (a bent class and a balanced class) achieve optimal algebraic immunity,
which is the motivation for the conjecture. They verified the conjecture numerically for
$k \le 29$ (Remark 3.1 of the ePrint version).

The conjecture is no longer open: [LLX26] and, independently, [Cu26] give complete proofs.
[Lean26] is a Lean 4 development of the same bound, stated for the count of natural-number
representatives $x < 2^k - 1$ rather than for the set of residue pairs used below.

**The Tu-Deng conjecture.** For $k \ge 2$ and a nonzero residue $t$ modulo $2^k - 1$, there
are at most $2^{k-1}$ pairs of residues $(a, b)$ with $a + b = t$ whose binary weights
(of their representatives in $0, \dots, 2^k - 2$) sum to at most $k - 1$.

Proved in [LLX26] and independently in [Cu26]; see also the Lean development [Lean26].
