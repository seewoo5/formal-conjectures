variable {α : Type} [Fintype α] [DecidableEq α] [Nonempty α]

/-- A family F of sets is Decreasing if it is closed under taking subsets. -/
def Decreasing (F : Finset (Finset α)) : Prop :=
    ∀ A B : Finset α, B ⊆ A → A ∈ F → B ∈ F

/-- A family F of sets is Intersecting if each pair of members has nonempty intersection. -/
def Intersecting (F : Finset (Finset α)) : Prop :=
    ∀ A ∈ F, ∀ B ∈ F, A ∩ B ≠ ∅

/--
If F is a decreasing family of sets of some finite type α, then there is some element
x of α such that the family consisting of all members of F containing x is an intersecting
subfamily of F with maximal cardinality.
