Does there always exist at least one prime between consecutive perfect squares?

/-- If there exists a constant `c > 0` such that
`(n + 1).nth Nat.Prime - n.nth Nat.Prime < (n.nth Nat.Prime) ^ (1 / 2 - c)` for all large `n`,
then Legendre's conjecture is asymptotically true. -/

Ferreira proved that the conjecture is true for sufficiently large n.
