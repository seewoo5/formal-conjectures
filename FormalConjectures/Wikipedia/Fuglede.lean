**Fuglede's conjecture** in two dimensions: A bounded subset of ℝ^2 with positive Lebesgue measure is spectral iff it tiles ℝ^2 by translation.

[Zh26], a July 2026 preprint, announces a negative answer in both directions, from two
explicit $60$-point subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_{60} \times \mathbb{Z}_{12}$ lifted to finite
unions of unit squares in $\mathbb{R}^2$. It is not yet published.

  sorry

/--
**Fuglede's conjecture** fails in every dimension $n \geq 3$: for each such $n$ there is a bounded
subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with positive Lebesgue measure that is spectral but does not tile
$\mathbb{R}^n$ by translation, or that tiles $\mathbb{R}^n$ by translation but is not spectral.
(Note that counterexamples in lower dimensions would also disprove the conjecture in higher
dimensions.)
