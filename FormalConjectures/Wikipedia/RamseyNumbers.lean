# Ramsey numbers

The (graph) Ramsey number $R(k,\ell)$ is the least natural number $n$ such that every simple graph
on $n$ vertices contains either a clique of size $k$ or an independent set of size $\ell$
(equivalently, the complement graph contains a clique of size $\ell$).

We formalize the classical open problem of determining $R(5,5)$, together with the currently best
known bounds $43 \le R(5,5) \le 46$.

Note: the diagonal Ramsey number $R(n,n)$ can also be formulated in terms of 2-colorings of
$2$-subsets, as `Combinatorics.hypergraphRamsey 2 n` (see `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/Combinatorics/Ramsey.lean`).

`IsGraphRamsey n k l` means that for every simple graph `G` on `n` vertices, either
- `G` contains a clique of size `k`, or
- the complement graph `Gᶜ` contains a clique of size `l` (equivalently, `G` contains an
  independent set of size `l`).

/- ## Other small Ramsey numbers

Besides $R(5,5)$, several small Ramsey numbers are known exactly, while others (such as $R(6,6)$)
remain open. The values below are collected in the dynamic survey [Rad] (see also
[OEIS A212954]): the exact diagonal value $R(4,4) = 18$, the exact off-diagonal values $R(3,k)$
for $3 \le k \le 9$, and $R(4,5) = 25$. -/
