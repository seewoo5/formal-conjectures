# Equidistributed Sequences

Corollary 4.2 of Chapter 1 states that the sequence $(x^n), n = 1, 2, ... ,$ is equidistributed modulo 1 for
almost all x > 1. And a little bit further down:
"one does not know whether sequences such as $(e^n)$, $(π^n)$, or even $((\frac 3 2)^n)$"
are equidistributed modulo 1 or not.

A point `x` is an accumulation point of a sequence `s_0, s_1, ...`
if any neighbourhood of `x` contains a point of the sequence distinct
from `x`.

If a point `x` is an accumulation point of a sequence `s_0, s_1, ...` then
there is a subsequence of `s` that tends to `x`

/-- It is not true that for every transcendental number `x` the sequence `x * (3 / 2) ^ n` is
equidistributed modulo `1`. The sequence `(3 / 2) ^ n` is lacunary, so by the theorem of
Pollington [Pol79] and de Mathan [Mat80] the set of real numbers `x` for which `x * (3 / 2) ^ n`
is not even dense modulo `1` has Hausdorff dimension `1`. This set is uncountable, so it contains
transcendental numbers. Alternatively, an elementary nested-interval construction (see issue
#5003) gives a Cantor set of `x` with `Int.fract (x * (3 / 2) ^ (8 * j)) ∈ [0, 1 / 10]` for all
`j`, which already rules out equidistribution for uncountably many, hence some transcendental,
`x`. By Koksma's metric theorem (Kuipers–Niederreiter, Chapter 1, Section 4), the sequence
`x * (3 / 2) ^ n` is equidistributed modulo `1` for almost all `x`. -/
