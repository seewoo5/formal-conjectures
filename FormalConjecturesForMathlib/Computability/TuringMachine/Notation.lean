/-! # Turing Machine Parser

This module provides a parser for defining a Turing machine from a simple string description.
The main entry point is the `turing_machine%` elaborator, which takes a string representing the
machine's transitions and constructs a term of type `Machine (Fin m) StateType` where `StateType`
is an inductive type generated on the fly.

## Encoding format

The machine's transitions are encoded as a single string, with each state's transitions
separated by an underscore (`_`).
For each state, a `3m`-character substring defines the behavior:
- The first 3 characters `"ABC"` describe the action when the head reads `0`:
  - `A`: The symbol to write (`0, 1, ..., m-1`).
  - `B`: The direction to move the head (`L` or `R`).
  - `C`: The new state (`A` through `Z`).
- The next 3 characters `"DEF"` describe the action when the head reads `1` using the same format.
- The next 3 characters `"GHI"` describe the action when the head reads `2` using the same format.
- So on...

The character `Z` is reserved for the halting state. The string `"---"` can be used to represent
a transition to the halting state without writing or moving.

Example of a tape: `1RA0LB_0LA---`

There are more examples in `ForMathlib/Test/Computability`.

  The encoding of a TM move by a (sub)string `"ABC"` works as follows:
    - The move the TM is currently at (the dictionary's key) is determined
      by the position of the substring
    - `A` gives the new symbol (`0` or `1`), `B` the direction the head moves
      (`L` or `R`) and `C` the new state (`0, ..., n-1` or `none`)

Machine described by the string `tmStringDescription`.

To do so, it
1) Runs `mkStateType` to add the state type to the environment
2) Defines the corresponding Turing Machine as a function using the `match` syntax.

Warning: if a state type (i.e. something with the name `State1, State2, ...`) already
exists in the environment then this will be reused without checking that this is the right
inductive type - such checks are left to the user.
